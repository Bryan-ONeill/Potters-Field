        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>Potters Field is a peaceful retreat built with care, designed as a sanctuary for reflection and transformation. This space embodies creativity, sacrifice, and resilience, offering a refuge for those in need of peace and connection to nature.</p>
        
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This sanctuary was built entirely by hand, with dedication, resourcefulness, and the skills I honed over decades of service. Every detail you see here reflects years of planning, effort, and an unyielding will to create something meaningful.</p>
        <p>As a former soldier and chef who has served in the British Army and the Territorial Army, I understand the value of discipline, ingenuity, and respect. This space is a testament to those qualities—and a reminder to treat it with care.</p>

        <h2>Guidelines</h2>
        <p>We kindly ask all visitors to respect the following:  
            <ul>
                <li>This is a private sanctuary; please tread carefully and respectfully.</li>
                <li>Vandalism or disrespectful behavior will not be tolerated.</li>
                <li>This area is under video surveillance for security purposes.</li>
                <li>If you choose to disrespect this space, remember: everything you see here was built by me alone. That same resourcefulness ensures I will find those who harm it.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
