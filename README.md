Potters Field

Potters Field is a hand-built, off-grid sanctuary on the banks of the River Mersey. It was created from nothing — a steep bramble slope turned into a place of reflection, work, and healing.

This is not a retreat, a spa, or a holiday camp. It’s a place for those who are broken, worn down, or lost to find strength again through hard, honest work and simple meditation.

Purpose

Offer a space where people can heal themselves through physical effort and quiet reflection.

Teach the value of resilience, patience, and simplicity.

Foster a small, respectful community of like-minded individuals.


What to Expect

Work: Everyone contributes. Gardening, building, repairing, maintaining the land.

Meditation: Time each day is set aside for silent thought and reflection.

Living Rough: Off-grid living — no luxuries, no excuses.

Self-Discipline: You will be responsible for your own growth. No one will do it for you.


Guidelines for Visitors

Respect the Land: Everything here was built by hand and hard work. Treat it with care.

Respect Others: This is a place of peace, not conflict.

Pull Your Weight: If you’re not working, you’re not staying.

No Substances: No drugs, alcohol, or anything that dulls the mind.

Currently, access is by invitation only.
